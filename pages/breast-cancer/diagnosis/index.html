                                <p>A more detailed X-ray examination than a screening mammogram. It focuses on areas of concern and may involve additional views of the breast. Diagnostic mammograms are used when there's a breast symptom or an abnormal finding on a screening mammogram.</p>

                        <p>A biopsy is the only definitive way to diagnose breast cancer. During a biopsy, a small amount of tissue or cells is removed from the suspicious area and examined under a microscope by a pathologist.

                                <p>A thin needle is used to withdraw a small sample of cells from a breast lump. This is the least invasive type of biopsy but doesn't always provide enough tissue for a complete diagnosis.</p>

                        <h2>Cancer Staging</h2>
                        <p>Staging describes the extent of cancer in the body and helps guide treatment decisions. The most common staging system for breast cancer is the TNM system:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>T (Tumor):</strong> Size and extent of the main tumor</li>
                            <li><strong>N (Nodes):</strong> Whether cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes</li>
                            <li><strong>M (Metastasis):</strong> Whether cancer has spread to distant parts of the body</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Based on TNM factors, breast cancer is assigned a stage from 0 to IV:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stage 0:</strong> Non-invasive cancer (DCIS)</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage I:</strong> Small, invasive cancer that has not spread</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage II:</strong> Cancer is larger or has spread to few nearby lymph nodes</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage III:</strong> Cancer has spread to many lymph nodes or nearby tissues</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage IV:</strong> Cancer has spread to distant organs (metastatic)</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) now also includes biomarkers (hormone receptor and HER2 status) and tumor grade in its staging system, as these factors significantly influence prognosis and treatment options.</p>

                        <h2>Getting a Second Opinion</h2>
                        <p>Seeking a second opinion is a common and often recommended step after a breast cancer diagnosis. A second opinion can:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Confirm your diagnosis</li>
                            <li>Provide additional treatment options</li>
                            <li>Give you peace of mind about your treatment plan</li>
                            <li>Help you feel more confident in your healthcare team</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Most doctors understand the value of second opinions and will not be offended if you seek one. Many insurance plans cover second opinions, but check with your insurer before making appointments.</p>
                        
                        <p>When seeking a second opinion:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask your doctor to recommend another specialist or look for specialists at National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers</li>
                            <li>Gather all relevant medical records, including imaging studies and pathology reports</li>
                            <li>Prepare a list of questions, especially about areas where you're uncertain</li>
                            <li>Consider bringing a family member or friend to help take notes</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Remember that the goal is to make informed decisions about your care. If the second opinion differs significantly from the first, you might consider getting a third opinion or asking the two doctors to discuss your case.</p>
