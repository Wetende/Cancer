                            <p>Breast cancer is not a single disease but rather a group of diseases that differ in how they grow and spread, how they appear on imaging tests, and how they respond to different treatments. Understanding the specific type of breast cancer is crucial for determining the most effective treatment approach.</p>
                            
                            <p>Breast cancers are generally categorized based on:</p>

                                <li>Where in the breast they start (ductal vs. lobular)</li>
                                <li>Whether they have spread beyond their origin (non-invasive vs. invasive)</li>
                                <li>Their molecular characteristics (hormone receptor status, HER2 status)</li>
