                        <h2>Why Screening Matters</h2>
                        <p>When breast cancer is detected early, the 5-year survival rate is 99%. Screening helps find breast cancer before there are symptoms, when it may be easier to treat. Regular screening is one of the most important things you can do for your breast health.</p>

                                <p>An X-ray picture of the breast. Mammograms can find tumors that are too small to feel. They can also find ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), abnormal cells in the lining of a breast duct that may become invasive cancer.</p>

                        <h2>Screening for High-Risk Women</h2>
                        <p>Women at high risk for breast cancer may need to start screening earlier and may benefit from additional screening tests. You may be at high risk if you have:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A known BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation</li>
                            <li>A first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with a BRCA mutation</li>
                            <li>A personal history of breast cancer, DCIS, LCIS, or precancerous breast changes</li>
                            <li>A strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer</li>
                            <li>Had radiation therapy to the chest between ages 10-30</li>
                            <li>Certain genetic syndromes like Li-Fraumeni or Cowden syndrome</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>If you are at high risk, your healthcare provider may recommend:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Starting mammograms earlier (often at age 30)</li>
                            <li>Having breast MRIs in addition to mammograms</li>
                            <li>More frequent clinical breast exams</li>
                            <li>Genetic counseling and possible testing</li>
                            <li>Medications or surgery to reduce risk</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Preparing for a Mammogram</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Schedule your mammogram for the week after your period when your breasts are less tender</li>
                            <li>Don't wear deodorant, perfume, lotion, or powder under your arms or on your breasts on the day of the exam</li>
                            <li>Wear a two-piece outfit so you only need to remove your top</li>
                            <li>Bring previous mammogram records if you're going to a new facility</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>During the Mammogram</h3>
                        <p>During a mammogram, your breast is placed on a flat support plate and compressed with a parallel plate. Compression is necessary to spread the breast tissue for better images and to reduce radiation exposure. You'll be asked to hold your breath for a few seconds while the X-ray is taken. The entire procedure takes about 20 minutes.</p>
                        
                        <h3>After the Mammogram</h3>
                        <p>You can resume normal activities immediately after your mammogram. You will usually receive results within a few days to a week. If there are any concerning findings, you may need additional imaging or a biopsy.</p>

                                    Are mammograms painful?
                                    <span class="accordion-icon"></span>
                                </button>
                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                    <p>Mammograms can be uncomfortable due to the compression of the breast tissue, but the discomfort is brief. Some women report more discomfort if they have the exam just before or during their period when breasts may be more sensitive. Taking an over-the-counter pain reliever about an hour before the exam may help.</p>

                                    Is there radiation risk from mammograms?
                                    <span class="accordion-icon"></span>
                                </button>
                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                    <p>The dose of radiation from a mammogram is very low. For most women, the benefits of mammography in detecting cancer early outweigh the small risks from radiation exposure. Modern mammography equipment uses the lowest radiation dose possible while still producing quality images.</p>

                                    What if I have dense breasts?

                                    <p>Dense breasts have more glandular and fibrous tissue than fatty tissue. Dense breast tissue can make it harder to see cancer on a mammogram. If you have dense breasts, your doctor may recommend additional screening tests such as ultrasound or MRI. Talk to your healthcare provider about your breast density and whether additional screening tests would be beneficial.</p>

                                    <p>There is no specific age at which mammograms should stop. The decision should be based on your overall health, life expectancy, and personal preferences. Many guidelines suggest continuing mammograms as long as a woman is in good health and would be a candidate for breast cancer treatment. Talk with your healthcare provider about what's right for you.</p>
