                        <h2>Breast Cancer Basics</h2>
                        <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.</p>
                        <p>Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most breast cancers begin in the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancers)</li>
                            <li>Some start in the glands that make breast milk (lobular cancers)</li>
                            <li>There are also other types that are less common</li>
                        </ul>
